//! # The Decide→Execute Spine
//!
//! This module is the literal, compiler-enforced realization of **ADR-002 — the
//! Decide→Execute Spine** (`papers/PPT-LAT-ADR-002-DECIDE-EXECUTE-SPINE.md`).
//! It replaces the ad-hoc `if SP_RECALL_L5 { … } else if SP_B3_WC { … } else if …`
//! ladder that grew inside `routes.rs` — a decade of workarounds stacked as env-gated
//! branches — with ONE seam and two roles:
//!
//! * **Tier 1 — Deciders.** Read an *immutable* [`LatentView`] (the query's latent
//!   footprint + the episode stores) and produce a discrete [`LatentDecision`].
//!   A decider CANNOT mutate the KV cache, CANNOT emit a token. The borrow checker
//!   enforces it: `refine` takes `&LatentView` and returns a value — nothing else.
//!
//! * **Tier 2 — the Executor.** Consumes a [`LatentDecision`] and drives the cache +
//!   SSE stream (deliver a fact in-context, decline, route, or pass through to normal
//!   generation). The executor NEVER sees a tensor — it takes the discrete intent only.
//!
//! **The boundary contract (why fusion is structurally impossible):** the only value
//! that crosses Tier-1 → Tier-2 is a `LatentDecision` — an enum of discrete intents,
//! no tensors, no logits. A decider that wanted to "fuse" latent content into
//! generation has no channel to do so: it returns an enum, and the enum carries only
//! an episode *selection* (an index/name), never a hidden state.
//!
//! **The dispatch is a fold.** The deciders form a *priority pipeline*: each one
//! refines the decision-so-far. A selector turns `Pass` into `Deliver`; an
//! attribute-grounding gate turns `Deliver` into `Decline`; a judge veto turns
//! `Deliver` back into `Pass`. Priority == order in the decider list. That single
//! `fold` expresses the whole recall/reject/decline logic that used to sprawl across
//! ~1500 lines.
//!
//! ```text
//!   LatentView ──▶ [ QOnly? L5Recall · AttrGate · JudgeVeto · … ] ──▶ LatentDecision
//!                       (fold: each decider refines the decision)          │
//!                                                                          ▼
//!                                              Executor: Deliver / Decline / Route / Pass
//! ```
//!
//! This first cut wires the LIVE one-config stack (L5 cosine recall → attribute-gate
//! zero-inference decline, QONLY-aware) through the spine and gates it against
//! G-ONECONFIG-LIVE (must reproduce 54/61). Telepathy routing, the generative judge
//! veto, the W_c / Jaccard / INT2 selectors, forget, and operator replay are modelled
//! as additional [`Decider`]s that slot into the SAME fold — the extension points are
//! named and typed so the next port is mechanical, not archaeological.
//!
//! Gated behind `SP_SPINE=1`; unset ⇒ the proven inline path in `routes.rs` runs
//! byte-for-byte unchanged (the null floor).
